SYNOPSIS

        use Data::Object::Immutable;
    
        my $object = Data::Object::Immutable->new([1..9]);
    
        $object->isa('Data::Object::Array'); # 1
        $object->count; # 9
    
        $object->[0]++; # fatal ... modification of a read-only value attempted

DESCRIPTION

    Data::Object::Immutable provides a mechanism for making any
    Data::Object data type object immutable. An immutable object is an
    object whose state cannot be modified after it is created; Immutable
    objects are often useful because they are inherently thread-safe,
    easier to reason about, and offer higher security than mutable objects.
