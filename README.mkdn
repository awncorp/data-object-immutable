# NAME

Data::Object::Immutable - Immutable Object for Perl 5

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/alnewkirk/Data-Object-Immutable.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/alnewkirk/Data-Object-Immutable)

# VERSION

version 0.08

# SYNOPSIS

    use Data::Object::Immutable;

    my $object = Data::Object::Immutable->new([1..9]);

    $object->isa('Data::Object::Array'); # 1
    $object->count; # 9

    $object->[0]++; # fatal ... modification of a read-only value attempted

# DESCRIPTION

Data::Object::Immutable provides a mechanism for making any [Data::Object](https://metacpan.org/pod/Data::Object)
data type object immutable. An immutable object is an object whose state cannot
be modified after it is created; Immutable objects are often useful because
they are inherently thread-safe, easier to reason about, and offer higher
security than mutable objects.
